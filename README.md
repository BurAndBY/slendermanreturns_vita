# Slenderman Returns
This is my first videogame ever realized using Unity 4.

# Description
Slender Man Returns is an psychological horror indie game, based on an urban legend about a murderous creature called Slender Man.

The game is completely in 3D, it is designed for the Windows platform, but I also made a port for the mobile version, and is controllable with comfortable touch buttons on the screen.

Slender Man Returns is a software project for the course of "Digital Game Development", C.d.L. in Computer Science, University of Catania. The teacher of the course is Prof. Giovanni Gallo.Ideazione, design and implementation of Rosario Terranova.
